# A Java Tomcat Vagrant Box

This is a Vagrant configuration for a Java Tomcat 7 box with essential tools.
The operating system is a UUbuntu 12.04 precise `64` image.

## Requirements

Obviously... [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

You will need the awesome [Fabric](http://fabfile.org) and 
[Fabtools](http://fabtools.readthedocs.org) to provision the box:

    pip install fabric
    pip install fabtools

## Running the box

You can start the box using the usual Vagrant `up` command:

    vagrant up

The next steps are obviously to provision it with Fabric, then log in:

    fab vagrant provision
    vagrant ssh

### Glassfish support

The box can be provisioned with [Glassfish](http://glassfish.org/):

    fab vagrant provision_glassfish

Glassfish is installed in `~/glassfish3` with the following configuration:

- admin user: `admin`
- admin password: `adminadmin`
- access to the HTTP interface from the host on port `18080`
- access to the HTTP admin console from the host on port `14848`
